## Components of the project

### Source code for preparing data records

:dart: [This repository](https://github.com/ces-unsw-edu-au/fireveg-db-exports) contains R, Python and SQL code to export data records from the database and upload to data repositories.

The code is documented using Jupyter Notebooks.

This repository is part of the OSF project component:
